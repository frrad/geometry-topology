\section{Let $M$ be a connected smooth manifold. Show that for any two non-zero tangent vectors $v_1$ at point $x_1$ and $v_2$ at a point $x_2$, there is a diffeomorphism $\phi : M \to M$ such that $\phi(x_1) = x_2$ and $d\phi(v_1) = v_2$.}

\section{Let $X$ and $Y$ be submanifolds of $\R^n$. Prove that for almost ever $a \in \R^n$, the translate $X + a$ intersects $Y$ transversely.}

\section{Let $\mat{n}{n}{\R} \simeq \R^{n^2}$ be the space of $n \times n$ matrices with real coefficients.}
\subsection{Show that $$ \SL{n}{\R} = \{ A \in \mat{n}{n}{\R} \mid \det(A) = 1 \}$$ is a smooth submanifold of \mat{n}{n}{\R}.}
\subsection{Identify the tangent space to $SL(n,\R)$ at the identity matrix $I_n$.}
\subsection{Show that \SL{n}{\R} has trivial Euler characteristic.}

\subsection{Let $f_i : M \to N$, $i = 0,1$, be two smooth maps between smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$, and $f_i^* : \Omega^*(N) \to \Omega^*(M)$, $i = 0,1$, be the induced chain maps between the respective de Rham complexes. Define the notion of chain homotopy between $f_0^*$ and $f_1^*$. Here the co-boundary operators on the de Rham complexes are the exterior derivatives.}
\subsection{Let $X$ be a smooth vector field on a compact smooth manifold $M$, and let $\phi_t: M \to M$ be the flow generated by $X$ at time $t$, i.e. the solution of the differential equation $\frac{d \phi_t}{dt}(x) = X(\phi_t(x))$ with initial condition $\phi_0(x) =x$. Find an explicit chain homotopy between the chain maps $\phi_0^*$ and $\phi_1^*$,  where $\phi_i^*$, $i = 0,1$, are the induced chain maps from $\Omega^*(M)$ to itself. \\ \hint{Use the formula that for any differential form $\omega$ and vector field $X$, the Lie derivative $\mathcal{L}_X \omega = d \circ i_X\omega + i_X \circ d \omega$. Here $i_X$ is the contraction with respect to $X$.} }


\section{Let $\omega = dx_1 \wedge dx_2 + dx_3 \wedge dx_4 + \cdots + dx_{2n-1}\wedge dx_{2n}$ be a 2-form on $\R^{2n}$, where $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{2n})$ are the standard coordinates on $\R^{2n}$. Define an $S^1$-action on $\R^{2n}$ as follows: for each $t \in S^1$, define $g_t : \R^{2n} \to \R^{2n}$ by considering $\R^{2n}$ as the direct sum of $n$ copies of $\R^2$ and rotating each $\R^2$ summand an angle $t$. Let $X$ be the vector field on $\R^{2n}$ defined by $X(x) = \frac{dg_t(x)}{dt} |_{t=0}$ for any $x \in \R^{2n}$. }
