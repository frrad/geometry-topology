\question{Let $M$ be a connected smooth manifold. Show that for any two non-zero tangent vectors
  $v_1$ at point $x_1$ and $v_2$ at a point $x_2$, there is a diffeomorphism $\phi : M \to M$ such
  that $\phi(x_1) = x_2$ and $d\phi(v_1) = v_2$.}

\question{Let $X$ and $Y$ be submanifolds of $\R^n$. Prove that for almost ever $a \in \R^n$, the
  translate $X + a$ intersects $Y$ transversely.}

  coefficients.}

  submanifold of \mat{n}{n}{\R}.}

\subquestion{Let $f_i : M \to N$, $i = 0,1$, be two smooth maps between smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$,
  and $f_i^* : \Omega^*(N) \to \Omega^*(M)$, $i = 0,1$, be the induced chain maps between the
  respective de Rham complexes. Define the notion of chain homotopy between $f_0^*$ and
  $f_1^*$. Here the co-boundary operators on the de Rham complexes are the exterior derivatives.}
\subquestion{Let $X$ be a smooth vector field on a compact smooth manifold $M$, and let $\phi_t: M
  \to M$ be the flow generated by $X$ at time $t$, i.e. the solution of the differential equation
  $\frac{d \phi_t}{dt}(x) = X(\phi_t(x))$ with initial condition $\phi_0(x) =x$. Find an explicit
  chain homotopy between the chain maps $\phi_0^*$ and $\phi_1^*$, where $\phi_i^*$, $i = 0,1$, are
  the induced chain maps from $\Omega^*(M)$ to itself. \\ \hint{Use the formula that for any
    differential form $\omega$ and vector field $X$, the Lie derivative $\mathcal{L}_X \omega = d
    \circ i_X\omega + i_X \circ d \omega$. Here $i_X$ is the contraction with respect to $X$.} }

\question{Let $\omega = dx_1 \wedge dx_2 + dx_3 \wedge dx_4 + \cdots + dx_{2n-1}\wedge dx_{2n}$ be a
  2-form on $\R^{2n}$, where $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{2n})$ are the standard coordinates on
  $\R^{2n}$. Define an $S^1$-action on $\R^{2n}$ as follows: for each $t \in S^1$, define $g_t :
  \R^{2n} \to \R^{2n}$ by considering $\R^{2n}$ as the direct sum of $n$ copies of $\R^2$ and
  rotating each $\R^2$ summand an angle $t$. Let $X$ be the vector field on $\R^{2n}$ defined by
  $X(x) = \frac{dg_t(x)}{dt} |_{t=0}$ for any $x \in \R^{2n}$. }

\subquestion{The $S^1$-action above induces an action on $S^{2n-1}$. Let $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ be the
  quotient space of $S^{2n-1}$ by this $S^1$-action. Show that the quotient space $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$
  has a natural smooth structure and that the tangent space of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ at any point
  $\underbar{x}$ can be identified with the quotient of the tangent space $T_xS^{2n-1}$ by the line
  spanned by $X(x)$, for any $x \in \underbar{x}$. Here $\underbar{x}$ is the orbit of $x$ under the
  $S^1$-action.}
